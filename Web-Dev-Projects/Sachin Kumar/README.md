My Portfolio Project:

This project showcases my portfolio using the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) stack, integrated with Lottie animations , and JavaScript for dynamic functionality.My first end to end MERN Stack project with the capabilities of dynamic storage along with Admin login ,can change data directly from the webpage without touching the code

Technologies Used:

1) MongoDB: Database to store portfolio data.
2) Express.js: Backend framework for handling server-side logic and API requests.
3) React.js: Frontend library for building interactive user interfaces.
4) Node.js: JavaScript runtime environment for server-side scripting.
5) Lottie: Used for animations to enhance user experience.
6) JavaScript: Language used for both frontend and backend development.
7) React-redux:For state management.

Features:

1) Dynamic Content: Fetches and displays portfolio data from MongoDB using RESTful APIs.
2) Interactive UI: Utilizes React.js components for a responsive and engaging user interface.
3) Animation: Lottie animations incorporated to enhance visual appeal and user engagement.
4) Admin Page
