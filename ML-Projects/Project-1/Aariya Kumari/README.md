# Multi-Layer-Perceptron-from-Scratch
Here I created multi layer preception with an accuracy of 65%. I got reference from " https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8yWXqWQYmU&t=279s " but very much modified it and get something to fit the data. It may not be the best model but here I have tried something.
