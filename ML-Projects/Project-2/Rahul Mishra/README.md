# handwrittendigitclassifier

    Hello everyone this is Rahul kumar Mishra a sophomore from electronics and communication engineering.

    This project is a handwritten digit classifier built on python using only numpy,pandas and matplotlib
    and no other deeplearning frameworks or data loading frameworks.

    This project is a deeplearning based three layer neural network digit classifier which is trained
    by the MNSIT_32 datset for the train as well as validation data set.

    The model is made on the jupyter notebook envoirnment and provides a test set acccuracy of 92%
    whereas a validation set acccuracy of 93%.
