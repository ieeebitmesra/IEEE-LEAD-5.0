# about me 

    Hello everyone this is Rahul kumar Mishra a sophomore from electronics and communication engineering, BIT Mesra.

# handwrittendigitclassifier

    This project is a deeplearning based three layer neural network digit classifier which is trained
    by the MNSIT_32 datset for the train as well as validation data set which can detect any handwritten digit
    between the range of 0-9.
    
    The model is made on the jupyter notebook envoirnment and provides a test set acccuracy of 92%
    whereas a validation set acccuracy of 93%.

# Packages and envoirnments required

    Below are the packages and envoirnments required to deploy this model :-
    1. A basic notebook envoirnment (jupyter notebook used for this model).
    2. Python
    3. Numpy
    4. Pandas
    5. Matplotlib
    6. MNSIT_32 dataset (from kaggle)

# How it works

    Download the code file given in the .ipynb extension file. Download the above mentioned packages and run the code on a basic python compiler
    or a notebook preferably jupyter notebook and enjoy :).
